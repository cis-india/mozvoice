        <h3 id="about">About</h3>

        <p><strong>“Even before you do anything Niki starts to talk to you.”<sup class="superscript"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup><a name="ref1"></a> </strong></p>

        <p> Several start-ups in India work at the intersection of voice and multilingual support. Niki is one of the few that directly provides this support to the individual. It is described by its developers as an “artificial intelligence powered conversational commerce startup”.<sup class="superscript"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup><a name="ref2"></a> This means that a person can use the app to make an array of digital payments with either text or voice commands.<sup class="superscript"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup><a name="ref3"></a> Niki was founded in 2015 as a voice-based assistant app in English; now, it provides information in multiple Indian languages via voice and text. The app allows people to use voice commands to complete a range of tasks, including paying utility bills, recharging prepaid mobile accounts, booking tickets for travel and accommodation, and availing local deals. The team at Niki focuses on the segment they call ‘middle India’, which includes customers from Tier 2, Tier 3, and Tier 4 cities; their aim is to bring the benefits of the online economy, without the barriers of language, to these new internet users. In 2020, Niki witnessed an increase of 1,000% in revenue, with a 22% increase in their user base to 550,000 users.<sup class="superscript"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup><a name="ref4"></a> The company has received funding from Ratan Tata, Unilazer Ventures, and SAP.iO, among others.<sup class="superscript"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup><a name="ref5"></a>
As per a 2020 report, Niki plans to raise USD 50 million (more than 300 crore) by early 2021. The team intends to use these funds to expand their market share and capture 20% of the 150 million ‘Bharat household’ (Indian household) market by the financial year 2022.<sup class="superscript"><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup><a name="ref6"></a></p>
    <h3 id="methodology">Methodology and process</h3>
      <p>This section enumerates the design and user research process that the team at Niki follows to understand the needs of their users and find new ways to help them.</p>
    <h4>Design process and user research</h4>
        <p> The process of creating voice datasets in Indian languages involved several steps, beginning with the selection of languages that are the focus of the project and then building speech technologies using the voice datasets. The selection of the 13 languages was based on the following criteria: optimal text selection, speaker selection, pronunciation variation, recording specification, text correction for handling out-of-the-vocabulary words, and data verification.<sup class="superscript"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup><a name="ref7"></a> To ensure the quality of data, characteristics that affect speech synthesis quality such as encoding (converting one form of data to another), sampling rate (number of samples of audio recorded every second) etc. were considered. The sentences for the speech recordings were taken through web crawlers from newspaper reports, Wikipedia pages, websites, and blogs in the respective Indian language. To achieve good coverage of topics and words, sentences were also taken from different types of literature, including children’s stories, science writing, tourism content, etc. Care was also taken to ensure that the texts were commonly used, free of errors, easy to read, and covered a wide range of words and syllables. Code-mixed sentences were avoided.</p>
        <h4>Design process and user research</h4>
        <p> According to the team at Niki, between 2016-2019, they have spent about 30,000 hours speaking to users. Research is a critical component of their design process. They have an in-house customer insights and research team that works towards understanding users better through various methods including on-ground research. For instance, the team of researchers, designers, and product managers travelled to Tier 3 (and below) cities such as Chomu, Pushkar, Ajmer, and Udaipur in Rajasthan to meet and undertake usability studies with residents. Usability studies are conducted to observe and understand the needs of a group of representative users.<sup class="superscript"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup><a name="ref7"></a>They involve observing users as they attempt to complete tasks using the product.</p>
        <p>The following are insights based on the key learnings from the user studies and the feedback collected in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities:</p>
        <p> Single-page and consistently guided user interface: The entire app should have a single-page user interface (UI) across services to maintain consistency. The user journey should be guided – the app should point users to the next step. Messages need to be crisp and to the point, and actionable items and messages should not be mixed. The content flows should be designed to be linear; multiple branches should be avoided.</p>
        <p> Acknowledgement messages: The research showed that it is important to  acknowledge  every action of the individual, as it gives them the confidence to use the app. All the ‘call to action’ and actionable elements must be consolidated in a specifically identified area.</p>
        <p> Apprehension about change: The research revealed that users were hesitant about trying new features for fear of failing. The team observed that they were diffident and nervous about trying anything they hadn’t previously encountered.</p>

      <h4>Text-to-speech synthesis</h4>
        <p>One of the researchers in the Indic TTS project defines text-to-speech synthesis as the “process of converting an arbitrary input text to its corresponding speech output”. In the context of Indian languages, the TTS system uses syllables or phonemes (units of sound that can distinguish one word from another in a particular language) as a sub-word unit (where words are split into smaller words that occur more frequently). The three major components involved in building a TTS system are text parsing, speech segmentation, and speech modelling.<sup class="superscript"><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup><a name="ref8"></a> Simply put, the objective of a TTS system is to convert text into speech output. TTS systems can be divided into two types – domain-specific and vocabulary independent. In the case of domain specific systems, the words/text to be synthesised should be limited to a particular domain, such as banking or railway broadcast, while for vocabulary independent systems, any text will work. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
          <h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
        <p>The main motivation for the project was to address the unavailability of voice data in Indian languages. The functioning of a TTS system is dependent on the training data that is fed into the system, which includes speech .wav files along with a transcript of the corresponding text. The TTS project aims to develop text-to-speech synthesisers for 13 Indian languages, which could help researchers and developers work on Indian voice applications. One of the goals of the project is to make the voice of the text-to-speech system sound as natural and understandable as possible. The first phase of the project concentrated on three languages (3 Indo-Aryan languages and 3 Dravidian languages), the second phase added 7 more languages to the study.</p>
        <h3 id="access">Access and accessibility</h3>
        <p>The TTS project was started with the idea of giving people with disabilities access to regional information on the internet, such as news reports in Indian languages. Since the consortium is a publicly funded project, the datasets and research have been made public on its website. The datasets are available free of cost to researchers – they just need to log in to the website to use them. Start-ups and businesses that want to use the data can sign a Memorandum Of Understanding with Indic TTS and access the data.</p>

      <h3 id="privacy">Privacy and data collection</h3>
        <p>As stated earlier, the text data for training the systems was taken from publicly available sources such as online news portals, Wikipedia pages, websites, and blogs; hence, privacy and data protection are not significant concerns. Additionally, with regard to the speech data, the readings were done by professional voice artists who recorded sounds and words for the project based on a script provided to them by the researchers.</p>

     <h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>

        <p>One of the main challenges for the researchers was ensuring that the datasets were comprehensive and accurate while keeping the cost of creating and accessing them low. Since the project was publicly funded, the researchers needed to work with the available funding and ensure that the research was accessible and free. As stated earlier, the data and the research are open to researchers,  and start-ups can request the data after signing an MOU. Another challenge was making the speech output sound more human-like and less robotic, similar to the heavily funded and data-rich interfaces of Amazon and Google. The other challenge was making the output speech systems context-specific, such as with children’s books.
        Voice interfaces provide accessibility support for individuals who are unable to see the screen or understand the text. However, no applications other than Google and Amazon claim to provide accessibility features. Amazon Echo’s website lists the various features that customers with vision, hearing, mobility, and speech accessibility needs could use. <sup class="superscript"><a href="#fn18">18</a></sup><a name="ref18"></a> Google Home provides accessibility features that allow the individual to control appliances and entertainment, make phone calls, broadcast messages, and manage tasks in addition to its voice assistant.<sup class="superscript"><a href="#fn19">19</a></sup><a name="ref19"></a></p>

      <h3 id="future">Future of Indic TTS</h3>
        <p>The project looks at continuing research and data collection with the help of government funding. Given the scale and amount of funding needed for such projects, including the requirement of infrastructure and trained human resources, the government is the primary source of funding. With the new funding from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, the researchers at IITM have started a project to make English lecture videos available in Indian languages. The objective of this project is to make lectures in different domains, like humanities, healthcare, etc., freely accessible to students in their languages. This is a small-scale project, and Indic TTS hopes to expand it to more languages and subjects. </p>
