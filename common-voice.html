        <h3 id="about">About</h3>

        <p><strong> ‘... to make voice data freely and publicly available, and make sure the data represents the diversity of real people.’<sup class="superscript"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup><a name="ref1"></a></strong></p>

          <p>Common Voice (CV) is an open-source dataset of voice recordings in multiple languages that can be used to train speech-enabled applications. With over 13, 905 validated hours recorded in 76 different languages as of July 2021<sup class="superscript"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup><a name="ref2"></a> CV strives to create and maintain the largest publicly available voice dataset of its kind. CV believes that the availability of large public voice datasets will help foster innovation and create a healthy market for machine-learning-based speech technologies. In May 2020, CV began data collection for a single-word target segment (the recording of single words in multiple languages) or voice data for single-word sentences (for example yes and no), to be deployed for specific use cases or purposes. The exercise has begun with the digits zero through nine, as well as the words yes, no, hey and Firefox”.<sup class="superscript"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup><a name="ref3"></a> </p>
    <h3 id="methodology">Methodology and process</h3>
    <h4>Language and text selection</h4>
        <p> The process of creating voice datasets in Indian languages involved several steps, beginning with the selection of languages that are the focus of the project and then building speech technologies using the voice datasets. The selection of the 13 languages was based on the following criteria: optimal text selection, speaker selection, pronunciation variation, recording specification, text correction for handling out-of-the-vocabulary words, and data verification.<sup class="superscript"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup><a name="ref7"></a> To ensure the quality of data, characteristics that affect speech synthesis quality such as encoding (converting one form of data to another), sampling rate (number of samples of audio recorded every second) etc. were considered. The sentences for the speech recordings were taken through web crawlers from newspaper reports, Wikipedia pages, websites, and blogs in the respective Indian language. To achieve good coverage of topics and words, sentences were also taken from different types of literature, including children’s stories, science writing, tourism content, etc. Care was also taken to ensure that the texts were commonly used, free of errors, easy to read, and covered a wide range of words and syllables. Code-mixed sentences were avoided.</p>
        <h4>Speaker selection and recording </h4>
        <p> To create speech recordings for the datasets, two voice talents – a male and a female – were chosen for each language. The recordings were made in a studio room without noise or echo for clarity of the recordings. The voice talents were voice professionals who were either voice artists or newsreaders to ensure clarity in the pronunciation and diction. They were given breaks every 45 minutes to avoid fatigue. In each recording, individual sentences were isolated. A total of 40 hours of speech data was collected for a given language – 20 hours of Indian monolingual/single language data (10 hours each of male and female voice data) and 20 hours of English data recorded by first language speakers (10 hours each of male and female voice data). The recorded files were stored in .wav format to ensure that the recordings were of high sound quality.</p>
      <h4>Text-to-speech synthesis</h4>
        <p>One of the researchers in the Indic TTS project defines text-to-speech synthesis as the “process of converting an arbitrary input text to its corresponding speech output”. In the context of Indian languages, the TTS system uses syllables or phonemes (units of sound that can distinguish one word from another in a particular language) as a sub-word unit (where words are split into smaller words that occur more frequently). The three major components involved in building a TTS system are text parsing, speech segmentation, and speech modelling.<sup class="superscript"><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup><a name="ref8"></a> Simply put, the objective of a TTS system is to convert text into speech output. TTS systems can be divided into two types – domain-specific and vocabulary independent. In the case of domain specific systems, the words/text to be synthesised should be limited to a particular domain, such as banking or railway broadcast, while for vocabulary independent systems, any text will work. </p>
          <h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
        <p>The main motivation for the project was to address the unavailability of voice data in Indian languages. The functioning of a TTS system is dependent on the training data that is fed into the system, which includes speech .wav files along with a transcript of the corresponding text. The TTS project aims to develop text-to-speech synthesisers for 13 Indian languages, which could help researchers and developers work on Indian voice applications. One of the goals of the project is to make the voice of the text-to-speech system sound as natural and understandable as possible. The first phase of the project concentrated on three languages (3 Indo-Aryan languages and 3 Dravidian languages), the second phase added 7 more languages to the study.</p>
        <h3 id="access">Access and accessibility</h3>
        <p>The TTS project was started with the idea of giving people with disabilities access to regional information on the internet, such as news reports in Indian languages. Since the consortium is a publicly funded project, the datasets and research have been made public on its website. The datasets are available free of cost to researchers – they just need to log in to the website to use them. Start-ups and businesses that want to use the data can sign a Memorandum Of Understanding with Indic TTS and access the data.</p>

      <h3 id="privacy">Privacy and data collection</h3>
        <p>As stated earlier, the text data for training the systems was taken from publicly available sources such as online news portals, Wikipedia pages, websites, and blogs; hence, privacy and data protection are not significant concerns. Additionally, with regard to the speech data, the readings were done by professional voice artists who recorded sounds and words for the project based on a script provided to them by the researchers.</p>

     <h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>

        <p>One of the main challenges for the researchers was ensuring that the datasets were comprehensive and accurate while keeping the cost of creating and accessing them low. Since the project was publicly funded, the researchers needed to work with the available funding and ensure that the research was accessible and free. As stated earlier, the data and the research are open to researchers,  and start-ups can request the data after signing an MOU. Another challenge was making the speech output sound more human-like and less robotic, similar to the heavily funded and data-rich interfaces of Amazon and Google. The other challenge was making the output speech systems context-specific, such as with children’s books.
        Voice interfaces provide accessibility support for individuals who are unable to see the screen or understand the text. However, no applications other than Google and Amazon claim to provide accessibility features. Amazon Echo’s website lists the various features that customers with vision, hearing, mobility, and speech accessibility needs could use. <sup class="superscript"><a href="#fn18">18</a></sup><a name="ref18"></a> Google Home provides accessibility features that allow the individual to control appliances and entertainment, make phone calls, broadcast messages, and manage tasks in addition to its voice assistant.<sup class="superscript"><a href="#fn19">19</a></sup><a name="ref19"></a></p>

      <h3 id="future">Future of Indic TTS</h3>
        <p>The project looks at continuing research and data collection with the help of government funding. Given the scale and amount of funding needed for such projects, including the requirement of infrastructure and trained human resources, the government is the primary source of funding. With the new funding from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, the researchers at IITM have started a project to make English lecture videos available in Indian languages. The objective of this project is to make lectures in different domains, like humanities, healthcare, etc., freely accessible to students in their languages. This is a small-scale project, and Indic TTS hopes to expand it to more languages and subjects. </p>
